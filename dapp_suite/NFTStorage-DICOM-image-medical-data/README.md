DICOM image as an NFT and its upload to IPFS using NFT.Storage and automation using FVM

We are developing a dapp using NFT.storage that let us export the DICOM image generated as an NFT and upload it to IPFS using NFT.Storage. We are extending NFTUp dapp both for Post PC and PC devices using ionic low code, no code framework and are using OP Calc for tabulation, organization and export of the DICOM output as an NFT.
