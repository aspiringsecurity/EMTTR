    <p>
        This is a set of libraries, applications, and utilities which make it
        easy to for developers to use the Æternity payment network. Including:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Vanillae.erl:</b> talk to an Æternity node from an Erlang application</li>
        <li><b>Sidekick:</b> talk to an Æternity browser wallet extension from a page script</li>
        <li><b>Jex:</b> a more intelligent alternative to NPM, specifically for packaging page scripts</li>
        <li><b>Jack Russell:</b> a browser wallet extension</li>
        <li><b>VDK:</b> a set of self-contained TS/JS libraries</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>3. Motivation/History</h2>

    <p>The two developers on this project are Craig Everett and Peter
    Harpending.  Craig is an Erlang graybeard. Peter is a recovering
    mathematician who reluctantly programs because food is kind of expensive.
    For the most part, Craig handles the Erlang stuff, and Peter handles the
    TypeScript stuff (hurray).</p>

    <p>Vanillae started as our own internal toolset that we developed in the
    process of making <a href="https://aegora.jp/">Aegora.jp</a>.  In
    particular, Craig developed Vanillae.erl because talking to the blockchain
    was needlessly annoying, and Peter developed Sidekick because the Æternity
    JavaScript SDK was (is) impossible to use.  We then open-sourced our
    tooling, and the Æternity Foundation decided to pay us to continue to
    develop it and expand it.</p>

    <p>Aegora is the first normal e-commerce platform that utilizes any form of
    cryptocurrency.  We would like if Aegora made us billionaires, but really
    Aegora is really a proof-of-concept; that concept being
    &quot;cryptocurrency could actually be useful.&quot;</p>

    <p>Our hope is that you (yes, <i>you</i>) will be inspired by Aegora, and
    go off and use Æternity for your own commercial projects.  The point of the
    Vanillae project is to make it easy for you to do that.  Craig and I are
    also working on a number of other projects to make Æternity useful to
    ordinary people, not just developers.</p>

    <p>Cryptocurrency has thus far failed to penetrate the economy of ordinary
    goods and services.  Cryptocurrency has been used on the dark web for
    buying babies and cocaine, and for various scams such as NFTs, fraudulent
    crypto exchanges, and pump-and-dump schemes. One has to ask: why?</p>

    <p>Our hypothesis is that most cryptocurrencies (i.e. every coin except
    Æternity) are technically deficient to the point that they are totally
    useless in the space of Things That Actually Have To Work (i.e.
    business).</p>

<div class="section yellowish" id="s-vanillae-erl">
    <h2>4. Vanillae.erl</h2>

    <p>
        This is an Erlang application that smooths over the rough edges
        involved in talking to Æternity nodes.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section skyish" id="s-sidekick">
    <h2>5. Sidekick</h2>

    <p>Sidekick is a simple, transparent, and self-contained library for
    talking to an Æternity browser wallet extension (e.g. Superhero [hence the
    name] or Jack Russell) from your page script.</p>
