<h3>API Tutorial</h3>

The API involves sending a blockchain request to
a <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/truflation/sample-frontend/main/ApiClient.sol">smart
contract</a> containing the following elements:

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>service:</b> is the name of the service provider

<li><b>data:</b> is the data provided to the provider with a request for
information.  Data consists of a json formatted object, and the values
for the object are dependent on the service provider.

</ul>
The remaining three parameters will select the response of the service
and convert it into a form which is usable for a smart contract.

<ul>
<li><b>keypath:</b> uses keypath selector to select one or more
  elements from the json provided by the service

<li><b>abi:</b> can take the following values
<ul>
<li>json - return response as json string
<li>cbor - return response as chor string
<li>ipfs or ipfs/json - return response via IPFS address
<li>ipfs/cbor - return response as IPFS address in cbor format
</ul>

abi can also be in the form of an EVM type in which case the byte
returned is formalled using EVM type such as int256, uint256, or
string

<li><b>multiplier:</b> - multiplys the value by a constant before
doing the format conversion.
</ul>
