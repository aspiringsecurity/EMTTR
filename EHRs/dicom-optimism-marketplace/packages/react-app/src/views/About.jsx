                   - What you see here is Danny's first step into reclaiming the value and context of his art which has been been held for ransom from predatory third-parties in previous iterations of fan economies. Lost & Found, Vol. 1 is the first collection of the greater Lost & Found universe <br />
                  - The next focus will be developing storylines and relationships between the characters through comic book strips and animated shorts. We’ll be adding new characters to the universe along with new color ways and different species in the same style as Vol. 1. Danny will create theme songs for specific characters. We’d also like to begin curating some of our favorite artwork in the Web3 world directly on this site. Eventually the hope is to inspire our favorite Web3 artists to create their own versions of these characters. Imagine a weekly reveal where the character is done in 5 different iterations by 5 different artists such as <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/defaced-n-friends"><u>Defaced</u></a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/XCOPYART"><u>XCOPYART</u></a>. All major decisions for this project will be influenced by owners + broader community.      
                  - This site serves as a direct link between Danny Diamonds and people looking to interact with his work <br/>
