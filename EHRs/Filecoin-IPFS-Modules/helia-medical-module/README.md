# HELIA MEDICAL Tests Module


- Implement the following scripts:
 - `clean`: used to clean all the unnecessary code (e.g.: files generated by bundlers and package managers)
 - `build`: used to build the example
 - `start`: used to start the example
 - `test`: used to test the example
- The `README.md` must have (see example inside `example-template`):
  - Link to `Codesandbox.com` for one-click running demonstration
  - References for documentation/tutorials used to build the example
  - _Optional:_ Screenshots, gifs, etc... under `img/` folder
- Update the CI to run the tests of the new example as standalone
  - Edit `github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - Add the test name to `project` under `matrix`

#### Update `helia` to run tests against the repo

Open a PR to the [ipfs/helia](https://github.com/ipfs/helia) project that edits the `.github/workflows/examples.yml` in order to make sure a Helia release does not break your new example.

Search `.github/workflows/test.yml` for the `test-examples` section and add a block at the end of the `example` matrix key similar to:

```yml
- name: my super fun new example
  repo: https://github.com/ipfs-examples/helia-my-super-fun-new-example.git
  deps: helia@$PWD/packages/helia/dist
```
