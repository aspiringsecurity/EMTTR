## Let's see the DTwitter magic!
Open two browser windows, and point them both to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). In one window, select the account used to create an account already. If you haven't already created a user, select an account and create a new user. Do the same in the second browser window, but select a different account. 

You should have two different user accounts. As an example, let's say we called the first user `DTwitterUser1`, and the second `DTwitterUser2`. 

1. In the first window (signed in as `DTwitterUser1`), type `DTwitterUser2` in to the search, and press `enter`.
2. In the second window (signed in as `DTwitterUser2`), type `DTwitterUser1` in to the search, and press `enter`.
3. Back in the first window, click the `Tweet` button and write a tweet, ie "Embark is the best dApp framework ever made!".
4. You should see the tweet automatically appear in the second window!
5. In the second window, add a tweet and watch it appear in the first window!
