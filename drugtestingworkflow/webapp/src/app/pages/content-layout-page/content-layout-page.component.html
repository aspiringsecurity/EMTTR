						<p>If you're new to Angular you may feel overwhelmed by the quantity of new concepts to apprehend, so before digging in
							this project you may want to start with <a href="https://angular.io/tutorial">this progressive tutorial</a> that will guide you
							step by step into building a complete Angular application.</p>
						<p><span class="text-bold-600 mt-2">AngularJS veteran</span></p>
						<p>If you come from AngularJS and want to dig straight in the new version, you may want to take a look at the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/ajs-quick-reference">AngularJS
							vs 4 quick reference</a> </p>
						<p><span class="text-bold-600 mt-2">Cheatsheet</span></p>
						<p>Until you know the full Angular API by heart, you may want to keep this <a href="https://angular.io/guide/cheatsheet">cheatsheet</a> 
							that resumes the syntax and features on a single page at hand.</p>
						<p><span class="text-bold-600 mt-2">Style guide</span></p>
						<p>This project follows the standard <a href="https://angular.io/styleguide">Angular style guide</a>.</p>
						<p>More that just coding rules, this style guide also gives advices and best practices for a good application architecture
							and is an **essential reading** for starters. Reading deeper, you can even find many explanations for some design
							choices of the framework.</p>
						<p><span class="text-bold-600 mt-2">Going deeper</span></p>
						<p>Even though they are not mandatory, Angular was designed for the use of design patterns you may not be accustomed to,
							like reactive programming, unidirectional data flow and centralized	state management.</p>
						<p>These concepts are difficult to resume in a few words, and despite being tightly related to each other they concern
							specific parts of an application flow, each being quite deep to learn on its own.</p>
						<p>You will essentially find here a list of good starting points to learn more on these subjects.</p>
