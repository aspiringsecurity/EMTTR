This tutorial teaches you how to use the [Optimism SDK](https://sdk.optimism.io/) to transfer ERC-20 tokens between Layer 1 (Ethereum) and Layer 2 (Optimism).
While you *could* use [the bridge contracts](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/standard-bridge/) directly, a [simple usage error](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/standard-bridge/#depositing-erc20s) can cause you to lock tokens in the bridge forever and lose their value. 
The SDK provides transparent safety rails to prevent that mistake.


**Note:** This tutorial is for the Bedrock release, which is currently running on the Optimism Goerli test network, but not on the production network.
Here is the [pre-Bedrock tutorial](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/tree/01e4f94fa2671cfed0c6c82257345f77b3b858ef/cross-dom-bridge-erc20).


## Setup

1. Ensure your computer has:
   - [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   - [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/)
   - [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

1. Clone this repository and enter it.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial.git
   cd optimism-tutorial/cross-dom-bridge-erc20
   ```

1. Install the necessary packages.

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

1. Go to [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) and create two applications:

   - An application on Goerli
   - An application on Optimistic Goerli

   Keep a copy of the two keys.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit it:

   1. Set `MNEMONIC` to point to an account that has ETH on the Goerli test network and the Optimism Goerli test network.
   1. Set `GOERLI_ALCHEMY_KEY` to the key for the Goerli app.
   1. Set `OPTIMISM_GOERLI_ALCHEMY_KEY` to the key for the Optimistic Goerli app

   [This faucet gives ETH on the Goerli network](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/). [This faucet gives ETH on the Optimism Goerli network](https://optimismfaucet.xyz/).


## Run the sample code

The sample code is in `index.js`, execute it.
After you execute it, wait. It is not unusual for each operation to take minutes on Goerli.
On the production network the withdrawals take around a week each, because of the [challenge period](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/messaging/#understanding-the-challenge-period).

### Expected output

The output from the script should be similar to:

```
Deposit ERC20
OUTb on L1:     OUTb on L2:
You don't have enough OUTb on L1. Let's call the faucet to fix that

```

As you can see, the total running time is about six minutes.
It could be longer.


## How does it work?


```js
#! /usr/local/bin/node

// Transfers between L1 and L2 using the Optimism SDK

const ethers = require("ethers")
const optimismSDK = require("@eth-optimism/sdk")
require('dotenv').config()

```

The libraries we need: [`ethers`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/), [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) and the Optimism SDK itself.

```js
const mnemonic = process.env.MNEMONIC
const l1Url = `https://eth-goerli.g.alchemy.com/v2/${process.env.GOERLI_KEY}`
const l2Url = `https://opt-goerli.g.alchemy.com/v2/${process.env.OPTIMISM_GOERLI_KEY}`
```

Configuration, read from `.env`.


```js
// Contract addresses for OPTb tokens, taken
// from https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/blob/master/data/OUTb/data.json
const erc20Addrs = {
  l1Addr: "0x32B3b2281717dA83463414af4E8CfB1970E56287",
  l2Addr: "0x3e7eF8f50246f725885102E8238CBba33F276747"
}    // erc20Addrs
```

The addresses of the ERC-20 token on L1 and L2.

```js
// Global variable because we need them almost everywhere
let crossChainMessenger
let l1ERC20, l2ERC20    // OUTb contracts to show ERC-20 transfers
let ourAddr   // Our address
```

The configuration parameters required for transfers.

### `getSigners`

This function returns the two signers (one for each layer). 

```js
const getSigners = async () => {
    const l1RpcProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(l1Url)    
    const l2RpcProvider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(l2Url)
```

The first step is to create the two providers, each connected to an endpoint in the appropriate layer.

```js
    const hdNode = ethers.utils.HDNode.fromMnemonic(mnemonic)
    const privateKey = hdNode.derivePath(ethers.utils.defaultPath).privateKey
```    

To derive the private key and address from a mnemonic it is not enough to create the `HDNode` ([Hierarchical Deterministic Node](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deterministic_wallet#Type_2:_Hierarchical_deterministic_wallet)).
The same mnemonic can be used for different blockchains (it's originally a Bitcoin standard), and the node with Ethereum information is under [`ethers.utils.defaultPath`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/single-page/#/v5/api/utils/hdnode/-%23-hdnodes--defaultpath).

```js    
    const l1Wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, l1RpcProvider)
    const l2Wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, l2RpcProvider)

    return [l1Wallet, l2Wallet]
}   // getSigners
```

Finally, create and return the wallets.
We need to use wallets, rather than providers, because we need to sign transactions.

### `erc20ABI`

A fragment of the ABI with the functions we need to call directly.


```js
const erc20ABI = [
  // balanceOf
  {
    constant: true,
    inputs: [{ name: "_owner", type: "address" }],
    name: "balanceOf",
    outputs: [{ name: "balance", type: "uint256" }],
    type: "function",
  },
```

This is `balanceOf` from the ERC-20 standard, used to get the balance of an address. 

```js
  // faucet
  {
    inputs: [],
    name: "faucet",
    outputs: [],
    stateMutability: "nonpayable",
    type: "function"
  }  
]    // erc20ABI
```

This is `faucet`, a function supported by the L1 contract, which gives the caller a thousand tokens.
Technically speaking we should have two ABIs, because the L2 contract does not have `faucet`, but that would be a needless complication in this case when we can just avoid trying to call it.


### `setup`

This function sets up the parameters we need for transfers.

```js
const setup = async() => {
  const [l1Signer, l2Signer] = await getSigners()
  ourAddr= l1Signer.address
```

Get the signers we need, and our address.

```js
  crossChainMessenger = new optimismSDK.CrossChainMessenger({
      l1ChainId: 5,    // Goerli value, 1 for mainnet
      l2ChainId: 420,  // Goerli value, 10 for mainnet
      l1SignerOrProvider: l1Signer,
      l2SignerOrProvider: l2Signer,
      bedrock: true
  })
```

Create the [`CrossChainMessenger`](https://sdk.optimism.io/classes/crosschainmessenger) object that we use to transfer assets.
At the current version of the SDK we need to specify that it is a bedrock transaction.
After the production network is upgraded to bedrock, that will be the default.


```js
  l1ERC20 = new ethers.Contract(erc20Addrs.l1Addr, erc20ABI, l1Signer)
  l2ERC20 = new ethers.Contract(erc20Addrs.l2Addr, erc20ABI, l2Signer)
}    // setup
```

The ERC20 contracts, one per layer.


```

### `reportERC20Balances`

This function reports the ERC-20 balances of the address on both layers.

```js
const reportERC20Balances = async () => {
  const l1Balance = (await l1ERC20.balanceOf(addr)).toString().slice(0,-18)
  const l2Balance = (await l2ERC20.balanceOf(addr)).toString().slice(0,-18)
  console.log(`OUTb on L1:${l1Balance}     OUTb on L2:${l2Balance}`)
```

Get the balances.

```js
  if (l1Balance != 0)
    return
```

If the L1 balance isn't zero, return - there is nothing we need to do.
Otherwise, call `l1ERC20.faucet()` to get the user `OUTb` tokens to deposit and withdraw through the bridge.

```js
  console.log(`You don't have enough OUTb on L1. Let's call the faucet to fix that`)
  const tx = (await l1ERC20.faucet())
  console.log(`Faucet tx: ${tx.hash}`)
  console.log(`\tMore info: https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/${tx.hash}`)
  await tx.wait()
  const newBalance = (await l1ERC20.balanceOf(addr)).toString().slice(0,-18)
  console.log(`New L1 OUTb balance: ${newBalance}`)
}    // reportERC20Balances
```


### `depositERC20`

This function shows how to deposit an ERC-20 token from Ethereum to Optimism.

```js
const oneToken = 1000000000000000000n
```

`OUTb` tokens are divided into $10^18$ basic units, same as ETH divided into wei. 

```js
const depositERC20 = async () => {

  console.log("Deposit ERC20")
  await reportERC20Balances()
```

To show that the deposit actually happened we show before and after balances.

```js  
  const start = new Date()

  // Need the l2 address to know which bridge is responsible
  const allowanceResponse = await crossChainMessenger.approveERC20(
    erc20Addrs.l1Addr, erc20Addrs.l2Addr, oneToken)
```

To enable the bridge to transfer ERC-20 tokens, it needs to get an allowance first.
The reason to use the SDK here is that it looks up the bridge address for us.
While most ERC-20 tokens go through the standard bridge, a few require custom business logic that has to be written into the bridge itself.
In those cases there is a custom bridge contract that needs to get the allowance. 

```js
  await allowanceResponse.wait()
  console.log(`Allowance given by tx ${allowanceResponse.hash}`)
  console.log(`\tMore info: https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/${allowanceResponse.hash}`)
  console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date()-start)/1000} seconds`)
```

Wait until the allowance transaction is processed and then report the time it took and the hash.

```js
  const response = await crossChainMessenger.depositERC20(
    erc20Addrs.l1Addr, erc20Addrs.l2Addr, oneToken)
```

[`crossChainMessenger.depositERC20()`](https://sdk.optimism.io/classes/crosschainmessenger#depositERC20-2) creates and sends the deposit trasaction on L1.

```js
  console.log(`Deposit transaction hash (on L1): ${response.hash}`)
  console.log(`\tMore info: https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/${response.hash}`)
  await response.wait()
```

Of course, it takes time for the transaction to actually be processed on L1.

```js
  console.log("Waiting for status to change to RELAYED")
  console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date()-start)/1000} seconds`)
  await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(response.hash,
                                                  optimismSDK.MessageStatus.RELAYED)
```

After the transaction is processed on L1 it needs to be picked up by an off-chain service and relayed to L2. 
To show that the deposit actually happened we need to wait until the message is relayed. 
The [`waitForMessageStatus`](https://sdk.optimism.io/classes/crosschainmessenger#waitForMessageStatus) function does this for us.
[Here are the statuses we can specify](https://sdk.optimism.io/enums/messagestatus).

The third parameter (which is optional) is a hashed array of options:
- `pollIntervalMs`: The poll interval
- `timeoutMs`: Maximum time to wait

```js
  await reportERC20Balances()
  console.log(`depositERC20 took ${(new Date()-start)/1000} seconds\n\n`)
}     // depositERC20()
```

Once the message is relayed the balance change on Optimism is practically instantaneous.
We can just report the balances and see that the L2 balance rose by 1 gwei.

### `withdrawERC20`

This function shows how to withdraw ERC-20 from Optimism to Ethereum.
The withdrawal process has these stages:

1. Submit the withdrawal transaction on Optimism.
1. Wait until the state root with the withdrawal is published (and the status changes to `optimismSDK.MessageStatus.READY_TO_PROVE`).
1. Submit the proof on L1 using `crossChainMessenger.proveMessage()`.
1. Wait the fault challenge period. 
   When this period is over, the status becomes `optimismSDK.MessageStatus.READY_FOR_RELAY`
1. Finalize to cause the actual withdrawal on L1 using `crossChainMessenger.proveMessage()`.

[You can read more about this in the documentation](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bedrock/how-is-bedrock-different/#two-phase-withdrawals).

```js
const withdrawERC20 = async () => {

  console.log("Withdraw ERC20")
  const start = new Date()
  await reportERC20Balances()
```

We want users to see their balances, and how long the withdrawal is taking.

```js
  const response = await crossChainMessenger.withdrawERC20(
    erc20Addrs.l1Addr, erc20Addrs.l2Addr, oneToken)
  console.log(`Transaction hash (on L2): ${response.hash}`)
  console.log(`\tFor more information: https://goerli-optimism.etherscan.io/tx/${response.hash}`)
  await response.wait()
```

This is the initial withdrawal transaction on Optimism.

```js
  console.log("Waiting for status to be READY_TO_PROVE")
  console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date()-start)/1000} seconds`)
  await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(response.hash, 
    optimismSDK.MessageStatus.READY_TO_PROVE)
```

The Merkle proof has to be submitted after the state root is written on L1.
On Goerli we usually submit a new state root every four minutes.
When the state root is updated, you see a new transaction [on the L2OutputOracle contract](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xE6Dfba0953616Bacab0c9A8ecb3a9BBa77FC15c0).

```js
  console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date()-start)/1000} seconds`)  
  await crossChainMessenger.proveMessage(response.hash)
```

Submit the Merkle proof, starting the challenge period.

```js
  console.log("In the challenge period, waiting for status READY_FOR_RELAY") 
  console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date()-start)/1000} seconds`)  
  await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(response.hash, 
                                                optimismSDK.MessageStatus.READY_FOR_RELAY)
```

Wait the challenge period.
On Goerli the challenge period is very short (a few seconds) to speed up debugging.
On the production network it is seven days for security.

```js
  console.log("Ready for relay, finalizing message now")
  console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date()-start)/1000} seconds`)  
  await crossChainMessenger.finalizeMessage(response.hash)
```

Finalize the withdrawal and actually get back the token.

```js
  console.log("Waiting for status to change to RELAYED")
  console.log(`Time so far ${(new Date()-start)/1000} seconds`)  
  await crossChainMessenger.waitForMessageStatus(response, 
    optimismSDK.MessageStatus.RELAYED)
  await reportERC20Balances()   
  console.log(`withdrawERC20 took ${(new Date()-start)/1000} seconds\n\n\n`)  
}     // withdrawERC20()
```

Wait for the message status to change to `optimismSDK.MessageStatus.RELAYED`, at which time the tokens are finally withdrawn.

### `main`

A `main` to run the setup followed by both operations.

```js
const main = async () => {
    await setup()
    await depositERC20()
    await withdrawERC20()
}  // main


main().then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error)
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

## Conclusion

You should now be able to write applications that use our SDK and bridge to transfer ERC-20 assets between layer 1 and layer 2. 

Note that for withdrawals of a commonly used ERC-20 token (or ETH) you would probably want to use a [third party bridge](https://www.optimism.io/apps/bridges) for higher speed and lower cost.
Here is the API documentation for some of those bridges:

* [Hop](https://docs.hop.exchange/js-sdk/getting-started)
* [Synapse](https://docs.synapseprotocol.com/bridge-sdk/sdk-reference/bridge-synapsebridge)
* [Across](https://docs.across.to/bridge/developers/across-sdk)
* [Celer Bridge](https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/developer/cbridge-sdk)
